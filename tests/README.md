# Testing
Each file in `src/` with any functionality that is not provided by a parent class or trait should have a corresponding test file in `tests/`. To run these tests, execute the following command:

```sh
$ composer test
```

> **Note:** Assumes that you are executing on a Unix-based system. Command might need to be modified to work on Windows systems (located in `composer.json`).
